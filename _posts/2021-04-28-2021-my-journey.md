My first memories of writing start with me at a Word Processor writing the action to *The Terminator*. This began a many year love affair with telling stories. I endeavoured to become a screenwriter, graduating from Spring Arbor University in 2006 with a degree in Film Studies. While my career in Hollywood was cut short, I continued to tell stories of a different sort.

Compelling stories can be found anywhere, so I began looking for them. I got involved in the California Workers' Compensation industry and I fell in love with the characters, their stories and advocating for injured workers.

My turn to Technical Writing came about because of my curiosity. I would look at procedures around the office and wonder why we did things a certain way, or finding gaps in procedure manuals. Through trial and error, I began figuring out why things worked on my figurative starship...and I began writing it all down.

Through it all, I became enamored with writing efficient and clear instructions. I began writing troubleshooting guides for the office. That progressed into documenting software whose manuals had long been lost. 

At a certain point, I started learning to code and branched out into web development, working on a few websites for friends and family. When my workplace needed a new website, I volunteered. Through these projects, I learned to use **Git** & **Heroku**, as well as other web development tools. 

As time went on, I kept adding tools to my toolbox. I began collecting data on various things--how long my average break was, how fast I could walk around the block, how much time I spent using particular apps on my phone. I soon began collecting data for work and performing gap analyses to figure out where there were bottlenecks. 

These days, you'll find me working remotely in Colorado, writing things down and analysing data.
