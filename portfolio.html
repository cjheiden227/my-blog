    <p class="lead">An accomplished technical writer with over 15 years of experience in developing and perfecting compelling, accurate content, I love diving deep into the mechanics of how and why products work.</p>
    <p class="lead">I eagerly expand my personal understanding by conducting research, attending webinars and virtual learning environments, engaging in cross-functional team collaboration, as well as fostering relationships with industry Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).</p>

    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p class="lead">Whether it's a concicse user manual, insightful software documentation or a compelling narrative, the process is the same.</p>

            <h3>1. Lay the Foundation</h3>
            <p>All good writing starts with the foundation - What Are You Writing About? It's a novel idea, but, true enough, you can't start writing unless you know what you're writing about!</p>
            <p>With my experience writing everything from fiction to trial briefs to user manausl and everything in between, it is key to know not only what you're writing about, but why.</p>

            <h3>2. Gather Information</h3>
            <p>Once I know what I'm doing and why, I move on to gathering information (and documenting everyting, of course). In cooking, this is known as <em>mise en place</em>, which means "everything in its place." I gather the information I need whether it's from interviewing Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), researching or testing products.</p>

            <h3>3. Build the Bridge</h3>
            <p>Once I've gathered my information, I Build the Bridge by writing it all down--get the first draft of my deliverable - the user manual, the software docs, the medical-legal report. I also edit for clarity and brevity, keeping in mind my intended audience. After all, if my audience can't understand, the bridge will fall.</p>

            <h3>4. Complete the Bridge</h3>
            <p>Once I have an accurate and complete draft, I make it look pretty. I apply whatever branding is required. I double-check for accuary and completeness. Once I (and my stakeholders) are satisfied, I deliver.</p>
