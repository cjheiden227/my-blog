    <p class="lead">An accomplished technical writer with over 15 years of experience in developing and perfecting compelling, accurate content, I love diving deep into the mechanics of how and why products work.</p>

    <h2>My Process</h2>
    <p class="lead">Whether it's a concicse user manual, insightful software documentation or a compelling narrative, my process is the same.</p>

            <h3>1. Start with an Idea</h3>
            <p>All good writing starts with the spark of an idea. Wherever the idea comes from, it's important to have one in mind when I start writing. It's a novel idea, but, true enough, you can't start writing unless you know what you're writing about!</p>

            <h3>2. Gather Information</h3>
            <p>Once I have an idea in mind, I move on to gathering information (and documenting everyting, of course). In cooking, this is known as <em>mise en place</em>, which means "everything in its place."</p>
            <p>I gather together the necessary "Ws" - What, Who, Where, Why, How. The Ws can take many forms depending on the final product.</p>

            <h3>3. Write It!</h3>
            <p>Once I have a good idea and I've gathered my information, I move on to writing a first draft of my deliverable - the user manual, the software docs, the medical-legal report. I also edit for clarity and brevity, keeping in mind my intended audience.</p>

            <h3>4. Produce the Deliverable</h3>
            <p>Once I have an accurate and complete draft, I make it look pretty. I apply whatever branding is required. I double-check for accuary and completeness. Once I (and my stakeholders) are satisfied, I deliver the deliverables.</p>
