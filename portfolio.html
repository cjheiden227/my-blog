    <h1>Creator of Clear, Compelling Documents</h1>
    <p class="lead">I am accomplished technical writer with over 15 years of experience in developing and perfecting compelling, accurate content for IT, legal, and healthcare industries. I am passionate about diving deep into the mechanics of how and why products work, collecting key requirements and data, and recombining the complex information into clear and direct written material for all levels of users, internal teams, and consumers.</p>
    <p class="lead">I eagerly accept new challenges that require expanding personal understanding by conducting research through online knowledge bases, webinars, virtual learning environments, cross-functional team collaboration, and relationships with industry subject matter experts (SMEs).</p>
    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p class="lead">My first memories of writing start with me at a Word Processor writing the action to <em>The Terminator</em>. This began a many year love affair with telling stories. I endeavoured to become a screenwriter, graduating from Spring Arbor University in 2006 with a degree in Film Studies. While my career in Hollywood was cut short, I continued to tell stories of a different sort.</p>
    <p class="lead">Compelling stories can be found anywhere, so I began looking for them. I got involved in the California Workers' Compensation industry and I fell in love with the characters, their stories and advocating for injured workers. </p>

    <p class="lead">My turn to <strong>Technical Writing</strong> came about in a different way. Perhaps you remember those exercises where you would have to describe to an alien how to make a peanut butter sandiwch. I'd always been fascinated by that exercise. I then became enamored with writing efficient and clear instructions. I began writing troubleshooting guides for the office. That progressed into documenting software whose manuals had long been lost. Through trial and error, I began figuring out why things worked on my figurative starship...and I began writing it all down.</p>

    <h2>My Process</h2>
    <p class="lead">Whether it's a concicse user manual, insightful software documentation or a compelling narrative, my process is the same.</p>

            <h3>1. Start with an Idea</h3>
            <p>All good writing starts with the spark of an idea. Wherever the idea comes from, it's important to have one in mind when I start writing. It's a novel idea, but, true enough, you can't start writing unless you know what you're writing about!</p>

            <h3>2. Gather Information</h3>
            <p>Once I have an idea in mind, I move on to gathering information (and documenting everyting, of course). In cooking, this is known as <em>mise en place</em>, which means "everything in its place."</p>
            <p>I gather together the necessary "Ws" - What, Who, Where, Why, How. The Ws can take many forms depending on the final product.</p>

            <h3>3. Write It!</h3>
            <p>Once I have a good idea and I've gathered my information, I move on to writing a first draft of my deliverable - the user manual, the software docs, the medical-legal report. I also edit for clarity and brevity, keeping in mind my intended audience.</p>

            <h3>4. Produce the Deliverable</h3>
            <p>Once I have an accurate and complete draft, I make it look pretty. I apply whatever branding is required. I double-check for accuary and completeness. Once I (and my stakeholders) are satisfied, I deliver the deliverables.</p>
