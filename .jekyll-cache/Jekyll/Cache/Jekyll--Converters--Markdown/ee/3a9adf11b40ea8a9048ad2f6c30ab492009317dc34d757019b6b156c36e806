I"¹<p>My first memories of writing start with me at a Word Processor writing the action to <em>The Terminator</em>. This began a many year love affair with telling stories. I endeavoured to become a screenwriter, graduating from Spring Arbor University in 2006 with a degree in Film Studies. While my career in Hollywood was cut short, I continued to tell stories of a different sort.</p>

<p>Compelling stories can be found anywhere, so I began looking for them. I got involved in the California Workersâ€™ Compensation industry and I fell in love with the characters, their stories and advocating for injured workers.</p>

<p>My turn to Technical Writing came about because of my curiosity. I would look at procedures around the office and wonder why we did things a certain way, or finding gaps in procedure manuals. Through trial and error, I began figuring out why things worked on my figurative starshipâ€¦and I began writing it all down.</p>

<p>Through it all, I became enamored with writing efficient and clear instructions. I began writing troubleshooting guides for the office. That progressed into documenting software whose manuals had long been lost.</p>

<p>At a certain point, I started learning to code and branched out into web development, working on a few websites for friends and family. When my workplace needed a new website, I volunteered. Through these projects, I learned to use <strong>Git</strong> &amp; <strong>Heroku</strong>, as well as other web development tools.</p>

<p>As time went on, I kept adding tools to my toolbox. I began collecting data on various thingsâ€“how long my average break was, how fast I could walk around the block, how much time I spent using particular apps on my phone. I soon began collecting data for work and performing gap analyses to figure out where there were bottlenecks.</p>

<p>These days, youâ€™ll find me working remotely in Colorado, writing things down and analysing data.</p>
