I"Å<p>My first memories of writing start with me at a Word Processor writing the action to <em>The Terminator</em>. This began a many year love affair with telling stories. I endeavoured to become a screenwriter, graduating from Spring Arbor University in 2006 with a degree in Film Studies. While my career in Hollywood was cut short, I continued to tell stories of a different sort.</p>

<p>Compelling stories can be found anywhere, so I began looking for them. I got involved in the California Workersâ€™ Compensation industry and I fell in love with the characters, their stories and advocating for injured workers.</p>

<p>My turn to Technical Writing came about in a different way. Perhaps you remember those exercises where you would have to describe to an alien how to make a peanut butter sandiwch. Iâ€™d always been fascinated by that exercise. I then became enamored with writing efficient and clear instructions. I began writing troubleshooting guides for the office. That progressed into documenting software whose manuals had long been lost. Through trial and error, I began figuring out why things worked on my figurative starshipâ€¦and I began writing it all down.</p>
